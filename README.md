# Presentations
A collection of all the different presentations I've made over the years.

The majority of these were made for a class called CS350 on computational geometry and spatial partitions.
Another large chunk were made while I was a student for physics club. The majority of these were on game physics dynamics (resolution).
A few presentations from my personal research (like my thesis) are included as well.
